  <!-- Texas Personal Injury Law -->
  <section class="section section-light">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Understanding Personal Injury Law in Texas</h2>
      <p>Texas personal injury law allows accident victims to seek compensation when someone else's negligence causes them harm. To successfully pursue a personal injury claim in Texas, you must establish four key elements: the defendant owed you a duty of care, they breached that duty, their breach caused your injuries, and you suffered actual damages as a result.</p>

      <div class="card-grid">
        <div class="card">
          <h3 class="mt-0">Statute of Limitations</h3>
          <p>In Texas, you generally have <strong>two years from the date of your injury</strong> to file a personal injury lawsuit. Missing this deadline typically bars you from recovering any compensation, regardless of how strong your case may be.</p>
          <a href="/texas-statute-of-limitations/">Learn about filing deadlines →</a>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3 class="mt-0">Comparative Negligence</h3>
          <p>Texas follows a <strong>modified comparative fault rule</strong>. You can recover damages as long as you're less than 51% at fault for the accident. Your compensation is reduced by your percentage of fault.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3 class="mt-0">Types of Damages</h3>
          <p>Texas allows recovery of <strong>economic damages</strong> (medical bills, lost wages), <strong>non-economic damages</strong> (pain and suffering), and in rare cases, <strong>punitive damages</strong> for gross negligence.</p>
