The injured person (plaintiff) seeks financial compensation from the responsible party (defendant) for their damages, including medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and other losses. Personal injury claims are civil matters, meaning they're separate from any criminal charges that might result from the same incident."

Signs you may have a case include: you were injured due to someone else's actions, you've incurred medical expenses or lost wages, and the injury occurred within the past two years. The best way to know for certain is to schedule a free consultation with a personal injury attorney."

The typical fee is 33% of your settlement if resolved before litigation and up to 40% if your case goes to trial. The law firm also advances all costs (filing fees, expert witnesses, medical records) and is only reimbursed from your settlement. If you don't recover compensation, you owe nothing."

However, there are exceptions: the discovery rule may extend the deadline if you didn't immediately know about your injury, minors have until their 20th birthday to file, and claims against government entities have a 6-month notice requirement. Missing the deadline typically bars your claim forever, so it's important to act promptly."

They may try to get a recorded statement, ask leading questions, or pressure you into a quick settlement before you know the full extent of your injuries. It's best to let your attorney handle all communications with insurance companies."

Unlike some states, Texas does not cap pain and suffering damages in most personal injury cases."

However, your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. For example, if you're awarded $100,000 but found 20% at fault, you'd receive $80,000. If you're found 51% or more at fault, you cannot recover any compensation."

Settlements can occur at any stage—during pre-litigation negotiations, after filing a lawsuit, during discovery, at mediation, or even during trial. However, having an attorney prepared and willing to go to trial often results in better settlement offers, as insurance companies know they may face a jury if they don't offer fair compensation."

Conditions like whiplash, traumatic brain injuries, internal bleeding, and soft tissue damage may not become apparent for hours or days. Seeing a doctor immediately creates crucial documentation linking your injuries to the accident. Delays in treatment can be used by insurance companies to argue your injuries weren't caused by the accident or aren't serious."

                            <h3>What is a personal injury claim?</h3>
                            <p>A personal injury claim is a legal action filed when someone is injured due to another party's negligence, recklessness, or intentional misconduct. The injured person (plaintiff) seeks financial compensation from the responsible party (defendant) for their damages.</p>
                            <p>Personal injury claims can arise from many situations, including car accidents, slip and falls, medical errors, defective products, and more. These are <strong>civil matters</strong>, meaning they're separate from any criminal charges that might result from the same incident. Your goal is compensation for your losses—not to send someone to jail.</p>

                            <h3>How do I know if I have a personal injury case?</h3>
                            <p>You may have a valid personal injury case if four legal elements are present:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Duty:</strong> The other party owed you a duty of care (for example, all drivers have a duty to drive safely)</li>
                                <li><strong>Breach:</strong> They violated that duty (they were texting while driving)</li>
                                <li><strong>Causation:</strong> Their breach directly caused your injury (their distracted driving caused the collision)</li>
                                <li><strong>Damages:</strong> You suffered actual harm or losses (medical bills, lost wages, pain)</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Signs you may have a case include being injured due to someone else's actions, incurring medical expenses or lost wages, and having the injury occur within the past two years.

                            <h3>How long do personal injury cases take?</h3>
                            <p>Personal injury case timelines vary considerably based on the specifics of your situation:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Simple cases</strong> with clear liability may settle in 3-6 months</li>
                                <li><strong>Moderate cases</strong> typically take 6-18 months</li>
                                <li><strong>Complex cases</strong> or those going to trial can take 2-3 years or longer</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Factors affecting duration include the severity of your injuries (you shouldn't settle until you've reached maximum medical improvement), the complexity of liability, the number of parties involved, the defendant's willingness to negotiate fairly, and court schedules if litigation becomes necessary.

                            <p>Every case is unique, and there's no way to determine its value without a thorough evaluation. Factors that influence case value include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The severity and permanence of your injuries</li>
                                <li>Your total medical expenses (past and future)</li>
                                <li>Lost income and diminished earning capacity</li>
                                <li>The impact on your daily life and relationships</li>
                                <li>The clarity of the defendant's liability</li>
                                <li>Available insurance coverage</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Do I need a lawyer for my injury claim?</h3>
                            <p>While you're not legally required to have an attorney, having experienced representation typically results in significantly higher compensation—even after attorney fees are deducted. Studies consistently show that represented claimants receive 3-4 times more than those who handle claims themselves.</p>

          </figure>
                            <p>Consider that insurance companies have teams of lawyers and adjusters working to minimize your payout. Without an attorney, you're negotiating alone against professionals who do this every day. A lawyer levels the playing field and handles the legal complexities while you focus on recovery.</p>
                            <p>That said, very minor injuries with minimal medical treatment and no lost wages might be handled independently. For anything involving significant injuries, disputed liability, or multiple parties, legal representation is strongly recommended.</p>

                            <p>Most personal injury lawyers, including our firm, work on a <strong>contingency fee</strong> basis. This means:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>No upfront costs:</strong> You pay nothing to hire us</li>
                                <li><strong>We advance all expenses:</strong> Filing fees, expert witnesses, medical records—we cover it</li>
                                <li><strong>We only get paid if you win:</strong> Our fee is a percentage of your recovery</li>
                            </ul>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Experience:</strong> How many cases similar to yours have they handled?</li>
                                <li><strong>Track record:</strong> What results have they achieved?</li>
                                <li><strong>Resources:</strong> Can they take your case to trial if necessary?</li>
                                <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Do they explain things clearly and return calls promptly?</li>
                                <li><strong>Comfort level:</strong> Do you trust them with your case?</li>

                            <p>Yes, you have the right to change attorneys at any time if you're dissatisfied with your representation. To switch, simply notify your current attorney in writing that you're terminating the relationship and request your case file.</p>
                            <p>Be aware that your former attorney may have a lien on your case for work already performed. This is typically handled at settlement—both attorneys' fees come out of your recovery, subject to the total agreed-upon percentage. If you're considering a switch, consult with a new attorney first to ensure a smooth transition.</p>

                            <p>In Texas, the general <strong>statute of limitations</strong> for personal injury claims is <strong>2 years</strong> from the date of injury. However, several exceptions exist:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Discovery rule:</strong> The clock may start when you discovered (or should have discovered) your injury rather than when it occurred</li>
                                <li><strong>Minors:</strong> Children have until their 20th birthday to file</li>
                                <li><strong>Mental incapacity:</strong> The deadline may be tolled during periods of incapacity</li>
                                <li><strong>Government claims:</strong> Claims against government entities require notice within 6 months</li>

                            <h3>Should I talk to the other driver's insurance company?</h3>
                            <p><strong>Generally, no.</strong> The other driver's insurance company is not on your side. Their adjusters are trained professionals whose job is to minimize what the company pays—not to help you get fair compensation.</p>
                            <p>When they call (and they will), they may:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Ask for a recorded statement (which can be used against you)</li>

                                <li>Try to get you to admit partial fault</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>It's best to politely decline to give a statement and let your attorney handle all communications with the insurance company.</p>

                            <p>Be very cautious about quick settlement offers. Insurance companies often make early offers hoping you'll accept before you realize the full extent of your injuries and damages. These offers are almost always <strong>far below fair value</strong>.</p>
                            <p>Once you accept a settlement and sign a release, you <strong>cannot go back for more</strong>—even if you later discover your injuries are more serious than initially thought. Never accept an offer without having an attorney evaluate your case and knowing your full medical prognosis.</p>

                                <li><strong>Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist (UM/UIM) coverage:</strong> Your own policy may cover you when the other driver can't</li>
                                <li><strong>Personal Injury Protection (PIP):</strong> If you have PIP coverage, it pays regardless of fault</li>
                                <li><strong>Other liable parties:</strong> An employer, vehicle owner, or another party might share liability</li>
                                <li><strong>Personal assets:</strong> In some cases, the at-fault driver may have assets to pursue</li>

                            <p>If you're filing a UM/UIM claim against your own policy, you're simply accessing coverage you've paid for. This shouldn't result in the same rate increase as an at-fault accident claim.</p>

                            <h3>Should I see a doctor even if I feel fine after an accident?</h3>
                            <p><strong>Yes, absolutely.</strong> Many serious injuries don't show immediate symptoms due to adrenaline and shock. Conditions that may not be apparent right away include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Whiplash and soft tissue injuries</li>

                            <p>Getting prompt medical attention creates crucial documentation connecting your injuries to the accident. Delays give insurance companies ammunition to argue your injuries weren't caused by the accident or aren't serious. See a doctor within 24-72 hours even if you feel fine.</p>

                                <li><strong>Your health insurance:</strong> This usually pays initially, then seeks reimbursement from your settlement</li>
                                <li><strong>Medical liens:</strong> Some providers will treat you on a lien, meaning they wait for payment from your settlement</li>
                                <li><strong>Personal Injury Protection (PIP):</strong> If you have this coverage, it can pay medical expenses regardless of fault</li>
                                <li><strong>Out of pocket:</strong> In some situations, you may need to pay and seek reimbursement</li>

                            <p>When your case settles, medical expenses are reimbursed from the settlement proceeds before you receive your share. Your attorney can often negotiate reductions in medical liens.</p>

                            <p><strong>Yes.</strong> In a personal injury case, you have the right to choose your own treating physicians. This is different from workers' compensation, where your employer's insurance may direct your care.</p>
                            <p>It's often beneficial to work with doctors who are experienced in treating injury victims and understand the documentation needed for legal claims. Your attorney can recommend physicians who will provide thorough treatment and proper documentation.</p>

                            <p>Having a pre-existing condition <strong>does not</strong> prevent you from recovering compensation. Texas follows the <strong>"eggshell plaintiff"</strong> rule, which means defendants must take victims as they find them.</p>
                            <p>If an accident aggravates or worsens a pre-existing condition, you can recover for the aggravation. Insurance companies often try to blame all symptoms on pre-existing conditions, but the law is on your side. What matters is proving the accident caused additional harm beyond your baseline condition.</p>

                            <p>Texas law allows recovery of three categories of damages:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Economic damages:</strong> Quantifiable financial losses including medical bills, lost wages, property damage, and future medical care and lost earning capacity</li>
                                <li><strong>Non-economic damages:</strong> Subjective losses including physical pain and suffering, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, disfigurement, and loss of consortium</li>
                                <li><strong>Punitive damages:</strong> In rare cases involving extreme misconduct (like drunk driving), additional damages may be awarded to punish the defendant</li>

                            <p>For <strong>most personal injury cases</strong>, Texas does not cap pain and suffering or other non-economic damages. Juries can award whatever amount they believe is fair.</p>
                            <p>However, there are caps in certain situations:</p>

                                <li><strong>Medical malpractice:</strong> Non-economic damages are capped at $250,000 per defendant, with a maximum of $500,000 total</li>
                                <li><strong>Government claims:</strong> Damages against government entities are capped at $250,000 per person, $500,000 per occurrence</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Standard car accidents, truck accidents, premises liability, and similar cases have no caps.</p>

                            <h3>How is pain and suffering calculated?</h3>
                            <p>Pain and suffering doesn't have a fixed formula, but two common approaches are used:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Multiplier method:</strong> Your economic damages are multiplied by a factor (typically 1.5-5) based on severity</li>
                                <li><strong>Per diem method:</strong> A daily rate is assigned for each day you experience pain or limitations</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In practice, pain and suffering values depend on the nature and duration of your injuries, the impact on your daily life, the credibility of your testimony, and jury attitudes in your venue.

                            <h3>Can I recover compensation if I was partially at fault?</h3>
                            <p>Yes. Texas follows a <strong>modified comparative negligence</strong> rule. You can recover compensation as long as you are <strong>less than 51% at fault</strong> for the accident.</p>
                            <p>However, your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. For example:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Total damages: $100,000</li>
                                <li>Your fault: 20%</li>
                                <li>Your recovery: $80,000</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If you're found 51% or more at fault, you cannot recover anything. Insurance companies routinely try to exaggerate the victim's fault to reduce payouts—an experienced attorney can combat these tactics.</p>

                            <p>Yes, you can pursue a claim for a dog bite injury in Texas. Texas uses a combination of approaches:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>One-bite rule:</strong> The owner is liable if they knew or should have known the dog was dangerous</li>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3>Do most personal injury cases settle out of court?</h3>
                            <p><strong>Yes.</strong> Approximately 95% of personal injury cases settle before going to trial. Settlements can occur at various stages:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Pre-litigation negotiations</li>
                                <li>After filing a lawsuit but before trial</li>
                                <li>During mediation</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>However, having an attorney who is prepared and willing to go to trial often results in better settlement offers. Insurance companies know they face unpredictable jury verdicts if they don't settle fairly.</p>

                            <p>After a settlement agreement is reached, expect the following timeline:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>1-2 weeks:</strong> Paperwork finalized and release signed</li>
                                <li><strong>2-4 weeks:</strong> Insurance company issues check to your attorney</li>
                                <li><strong>1-2 weeks:</strong> Medical liens resolved and disbursement processed</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Total time from settlement to receiving your check is typically <strong>4-8 weeks</strong>. Delays can occur if there are complex medical liens to negotiate or disputes about the settlement terms.</p>

                            <p><strong>Usually not.</strong> Most cases settle without ever going to court. However, even in cases that don't go to trial, you may need to:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Give a deposition:</strong> Answer questions under oath from the defense attorney</li>
                                <li><strong>Attend mediation:</strong> A negotiation session with a neutral mediator</li>
                                <li><strong>Undergo an independent medical examination:</strong> An exam by a doctor chosen by the insurance company</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If your case does go to trial, you'll need to attend and may testify. Your attorney will thoroughly prepare you for any required appearances.</p>
