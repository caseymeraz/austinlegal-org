                        <h2>At the Accident Scene</h2>

                        <h3>Step 1 – Check for Injuries</h3>
                        <p>Your first priority is safety. Before anything else:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assess yourself for injuries—can you move without pain?</li>
                            <li>Check on passengers in your vehicle</li>
                            <li>If anyone is seriously injured, call 911 immediately</li>
                            <li>Don't move anyone who may have neck or spine injuries unless there's immediate danger (like fire)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Remember: some injuries, like whiplash or internal bleeding, may not be immediately apparent due to adrenaline.</p>

                        <h3>Step 2 – Move to Safety</h3>
                        <p>If the accident is minor and vehicles are drivable:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Move cars out of traffic lanes if possible</li>
                            <li>Turn on hazard lights</li>
                            <li>Set up flares or warning triangles if you have them</li>
                            <li>Position yourself safely away from moving traffic</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If vehicles can't be moved, get yourself to a safe location while waiting for police.</p>

                        <h3>Step 3 – Call 911</h3>
                        <p>Always call 911 after a car accident, especially if:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Anyone is injured</li>
                            <li>There appears to be significant property damage</li>
                            <li>The other driver seems impaired</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Texas law requires you to report any accident involving injury, death, or property damage exceeding $1,000. A police report creates an official record of the accident and is crucial evidence for your claim.</p>

                        <h3>Step 4 – Exchange Information</h3>
                        <p>Get the following information from all other drivers involved:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Full name and contact information</li>
                            <li>Driver's license number</li>
                            <li>Insurance company name and policy number</li>
                            <li>Vehicle make, model, year, and color</li>
                            <li>License plate number</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Exchange information factually. Don't discuss who was at fault, don't apologize, and don't make statements about the accident beyond basic facts.</p>

                        <h3>Step 5 – Document Everything</h3>
                        <p>Your smartphone is a powerful documentation tool. Take photos of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>All vehicles involved from multiple angles</li>
                            <li>Damage to each vehicle (close-ups and wide shots)</li>
                            <li>The accident scene including road conditions</li>
                            <li>Traffic signs, signals, and road markings</li>
                            <li>Skid marks or debris</li>
                            <li>Any visible injuries</li>
                            <li>Weather and lighting conditions</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The more documentation you have, the stronger your case will be.</p>

                        <h3>Step 6 – Get Witness Information</h3>
                        <p>If anyone saw the accident happen:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Get their name and phone number</li>
                            <li>Ask briefly what they observed</li>
                            <li>Their testimony could be crucial if fault is disputed</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Witnesses often leave the scene quickly, so gather this information promptly.</p>

                    <section class="content-section">
                        <h2>What NOT to Do at the Scene</h2>

                        <h3>Don't Admit Fault</h3>
                        <p>Even if you think you may have contributed to the accident, don't admit fault at the scene. Simple statements like "I'm sorry" or "I didn't see you" can be used against you later. Fault is determined by a thorough investigation—not by on-scene emotions.</p>

            <img src="/images/medical-care.jpg" alt="Medical professional providing care after an accident" width="1200" height="800">
          </figure>

                        <h3>Don't Argue with the Other Driver</h3>
                        <p>Emotions run high after accidents. Stay calm, stick to exchanging information, and avoid confrontation. If the other driver becomes aggressive, stay in your vehicle and wait for police.</p>

                        <h3>Don't Leave the Scene</h3>
                        <p>Leaving the scene of an accident is a crime in Texas, even for minor collisions. Always:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stay at the scene until police release you</li>
                            <li>Exchange information with other drivers</li>
                            <li>Wait for the police report to be taken</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Don't Refuse Medical Attention</h3>
                        <p>If EMTs respond to the scene, don't refuse evaluation. Adrenaline can mask serious injuries, and refusing medical attention is documented—which insurance companies use to argue you weren't really hurt.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="content-section">
                        <h2>After Leaving the Scene</h2>

                        <h3>Seek Medical Attention</h3>
                        <p>Even if you feel fine, see a doctor within 24-72 hours of your accident. Many injuries don't show symptoms immediately:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Whiplash often takes 24-48 hours to present</li>
                            <li>Internal bleeding may not be obvious</li>
                            <li>Concussions can have delayed symptoms</li>
                            <li>Soft tissue injuries worsen over time</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Medical documentation is crucial for your claim. Follow all treatment recommendations and attend all follow-up appointments.</p>

                        <h3>Report to Your Insurance Company</h3>
                        <p>Notify your insurance company about the accident promptly. When reporting:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provide basic facts about the accident</li>
                            <li>Don't speculate about fault</li>
                            <li>Don't give a recorded statement without first consulting an attorney</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Don't Post on Social Media</h3>
                        <p>Insurance companies routinely monitor claimants' social media accounts looking for posts that contradict injury claims. Until your case is resolved:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Don't post about the accident</li>
                            <li>Don't post photos that could be misinterpreted</li>
                            <li>Avoid discussing your injuries or activities online</li>
                            <li>Consider making accounts private</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Dealing with Insurance Companies</h2>

                        <h3>Their Goal vs. Your Goal</h3>
                        <p>Remember: insurance adjusters work for the insurance company, not for you. Their goal is to minimize payouts. Your goal is to receive fair compensation for your injuries, lost wages, and suffering.</p>

                        <h3>Don't Give Recorded Statements</h3>
                        <p>The other driver's insurance company may call asking for a recorded statement. You are <strong>not required</strong> to give one. These statements are often used to find inconsistencies or statements that can be used to reduce or deny your claim. Let your attorney handle these communications.</p>

                        <h3>Don't Accept Quick Settlements</h3>
                        <p>Insurance companies often make quick, lowball settlement offers hoping you'll accept before understanding the full extent of your injuries. Never sign anything or accept a settlement without consulting an attorney. Once you sign a release, you give up all future claims—even if your injuries turn out to be worse than initially thought.</p>

                        <h2>Texas-Specific Considerations</h2>

                        <h3>Texas is an At-Fault State</h3>
                        <p>Texas follows an "at-fault" system for car accidents, meaning the driver who caused the accident is responsible for damages. You can file a claim against the at-fault driver's insurance or sue them directly.</p>

                        <p>Texas also uses "modified comparative negligence"—you can recover damages even if you were partially at fault, as long as your fault is 50% or less. Your compensation is reduced by your percentage of fault.</p>

                        <h3>Texas Minimum Insurance Requirements</h3>
                        <p>Texas requires drivers to carry minimum liability coverage of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>$30,000 bodily injury per person</li>
                            <li>$60,000 bodily injury per accident</li>
                            <li>$25,000 property damage</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Unfortunately, many drivers carry only these minimums, which may not cover serious injuries. An attorney can help identify all potential sources of compensation.</p>

                        <h3>Statute of Limitations</h3>
                        <p>In Texas, you generally have <strong>2 years from the date of the accident</strong> to file a personal injury lawsuit. Missing this deadline means losing your right to sue. Learn more about the <a href="/texas-statute-of-limitations/">Texas statute of limitations</a>.</p>
