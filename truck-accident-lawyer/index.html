          <p>Truck accidents are among the most catastrophic events on Texas roadways. When a fully-loaded 18-wheeler weighing up to 80,000 pounds collides with a passenger vehicle, the results are often fatal or life-altering. Survivors frequently face extensive surgeries, permanent disabilities, and mountains of medical debt.</p>

          <p>At The Juris Firm, our Austin truck accident lawyers have the experience and resources necessary to take on major trucking companies and their teams of corporate lawyers and insurance adjusters. We understand the complex federal regulations that govern the trucking industry, and we know how to investigate these accidents to uncover the evidence needed to prove liability and maximize your compensation.</p>

          <h2>Why Truck Accident Cases Are Different</h2>

          <p>Truck accident cases are significantly more complex than typical car accident claims. Here's why you need an attorney who specializes in these cases:</p>

          <h3>Multiple Liable Parties</h3>
          <p>Unlike car accidents where only the driver is typically responsible, truck accidents may involve multiple defendants:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>The truck driver</strong> – for negligent driving, fatigue, or impairment</li>
            <li><strong>The trucking company</strong> – for negligent hiring, training, or supervision</li>
            <li><strong>The cargo loading company</strong> – for improperly loaded or secured cargo</li>
            <li><strong>The truck manufacturer</strong> – for defective parts or equipment</li>
            <li><strong>Maintenance providers</strong> – for negligent repairs or inspections</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Identifying all potentially liable parties is crucial to maximizing your recovery.</p>

          <h3>Federal Regulations</h3>
          <p>Commercial trucks are governed by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulations, which impose strict requirements on trucking companies and drivers, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Hours of Service rules</strong> limiting driving time to prevent fatigue</li>
            <li><strong>Driver qualification standards</strong> including drug and alcohol testing</li>
            <li><strong>Vehicle maintenance and inspection requirements</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Cargo securement standards</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Electronic Logging Device (ELD) mandates</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Violations of these regulations can be powerful evidence of negligence in your case.</p>

          <h3>Evidence Preservation</h3>
          <p>Critical evidence in truck accident cases can disappear quickly if not preserved. This includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Electronic logging device (ELD) data showing hours of service</li>
            <li>Black box data recording speed, braking, and other factors</li>
            <li>Driver qualification files and employment records</li>
            <li>Drug and alcohol testing results</li>
            <li>Truck inspection and maintenance records</li>
            <li>Cargo manifests and loading documentation</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We act quickly to send spoliation letters and preserve this evidence before it's lost or destroyed.</p>

          <h2>Common Causes of Truck Accidents in Austin</h2>

          <h3>Driver Fatigue</h3>
          <p>Despite hours-of-service regulations, truck driver fatigue remains a leading cause of accidents. Pressure to meet delivery deadlines pushes many drivers to falsify logs or continue driving when they should rest. Fatigue slows reaction times and impairs judgment as severely as alcohol impairment.</p>

          <h3>Distracted Driving</h3>
          <p>Texting, using GPS systems, eating, and other distractions are particularly dangerous when operating an 80,000-pound vehicle at highway speeds. A few seconds of distraction can lead to catastrophic consequences.</p>

          <h3>Improper Loading</h3>
          <p>Overloaded trucks or improperly secured cargo can cause trucks to tip over, jackknife, or lose cargo on the roadway. Proper weight distribution is essential for safe truck operation.</p>

          <h3>Inadequate Maintenance</h3>
          <p>Trucking companies that cut corners on maintenance put everyone at risk. Brake failures, tire blowouts, and steering malfunctions can all lead to devastating accidents.</p>

          <h3>Speeding and Aggressive Driving</h3>
          <p>Commercial trucks require much longer distances to stop than passenger vehicles. Speeding dramatically increases both the likelihood and severity of accidents.</p>

          <h3>Impaired Driving</h3>
          <p>Despite drug and alcohol testing requirements, some truck drivers operate while impaired by alcohol, illegal drugs, or even prescription medications that affect their ability to drive safely.</p>

          <h2>Types of Truck Accidents</h2>

          <h3>Jackknife Accidents</h3>
          <p>When a truck's trailer swings out to form a 90-degree angle with the cab, it can sweep across multiple lanes of traffic, striking multiple vehicles.</p>

          <h3>Rear-End Collisions</h3>
          <p>The massive weight of a commercial truck means that rear-end collisions often crush the vehicle in front, causing catastrophic injuries or death.</p>

          <h3>Underride Accidents</h3>
          <p>When a smaller vehicle slides under a truck's trailer, the results are often fatal. These accidents can occur at the rear or side of the trailer.</p>

          <h3>Wide Turn Accidents</h3>
          <p>Trucks require extra space to complete turns. Drivers who misjudge these turns can crush vehicles beside them or strike pedestrians.</p>

          <h3>Tire Blowouts</h3>
          <p>When a truck tire blows out at highway speed, the driver may lose control, and tire debris can strike other vehicles.</p>

          <h3>Cargo Spills</h3>
          <p>Improperly secured cargo can fall from trucks, creating hazards for following vehicles or causing the truck to become unstable.</p>

          <h2>Truck Accident Injuries</h2>

          <p>Due to the size disparity between commercial trucks and passenger vehicles, truck accident injuries are often severe or fatal:</p>

          <ul class="check-list">
            <li><strong>Traumatic brain injuries</strong> – often resulting in permanent cognitive impairment</li>
            <li><strong>Spinal cord injuries</strong> – including paraplegia and quadriplegia</li>
            <li><strong>Multiple bone fractures</strong> – requiring extensive surgery and rehabilitation</li>
            <li><strong>Internal organ damage</strong> – potentially life-threatening</li>
            <li><strong>Severe burns</strong> – from fuel fires following the collision</li>
            <li><strong>Amputation</strong> – loss of limbs due to crushing injuries</li>
            <li><strong>Wrongful death</strong> – leaving families devastated by sudden loss</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Compensation in Truck Accident Cases</h2>

          <p>Because truck accident injuries are typically severe, compensation in these cases is often substantial. You may be entitled to recover:</p>

          <h3>Economic Damages</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Past and future medical expenses</li>
            <li>Rehabilitation and physical therapy costs</li>
            <li>Lost wages and lost earning capacity</li>
            <li>Home modifications for disability</li>
            <li>In-home nursing care</li>
            <li>Assistive devices and equipment</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Non-Economic Damages</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Physical pain and suffering</li>
            <li>Emotional distress and mental anguish</li>
            <li>Loss of enjoyment of life</li>
            <li>Disfigurement and scarring</li>
            <li>Loss of consortium (for spouse)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Punitive Damages</h3>
          <p>In cases involving gross negligence—such as a trucking company knowingly allowing a driver to violate hours-of-service rules—punitive damages may be awarded to punish the wrongdoer.</p>
