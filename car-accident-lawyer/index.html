        <div class="content-section">
          <p>Every year, thousands of Austin residents are injured in car accidents on our busy highways and city streets. From minor fender-benders to catastrophic collisions, the aftermath of a car accident can be overwhelming. Medical bills pile up, you may be unable to work, and dealing with insurance companies adds stress to an already difficult situation.</p>

          <p>At The Juris Firm, our Austin car accident lawyers understand what you're going through. We've spent over two decades helping accident victims navigate the complex process of seeking compensation. Our goal is simple: to handle every aspect of your legal claim so you can focus on what matters most—your recovery.</p>

          <h2>Common Causes of Car Accidents in Austin</h2>

          <p>Austin's rapid growth has led to increased traffic and, unfortunately, more accidents. Our car accident attorneys regularly handle cases involving:</p>

          <h3>Distracted Driving</h3>
          <p>Texting, phone calls, GPS navigation, and other distractions are leading causes of Austin car accidents. When drivers take their eyes off the road—even for a few seconds—the results can be devastating. Texas law prohibits texting while driving, and violating this law can be powerful evidence of negligence in your case.</p>

          <h3>Speeding and Reckless Driving</h3>
          <p>Whether on I-35, MoPac, or city streets, speeding dramatically increases both the likelihood and severity of accidents. Drivers who exceed the speed limit or drive recklessly may be held liable for all damages resulting from their dangerous behavior.</p>

          <h3>Drunk and Impaired Driving</h3>
          <p>Despite strict DUI laws, drunk driving remains a serious problem in Austin. If you were hit by an impaired driver, you may be entitled to punitive damages in addition to compensation for your injuries. These damages are designed to punish the wrongdoer and deter similar conduct.</p>

          <h3>Running Red Lights and Stop Signs</h3>
          <p>Intersection accidents are among the most dangerous because they often result in T-bone (side-impact) collisions. These crashes frequently cause severe injuries because the side of a vehicle offers less protection than the front or rear.</p>

          <h3>Failure to Yield</h3>
          <p>Many accidents occur when drivers fail to yield the right of way during lane changes, merging, or at intersections. These accidents are particularly common in Austin's heavy traffic areas.</p>

          <h3>Weather-Related Accidents</h3>
          <p>While Austin enjoys mostly pleasant weather, sudden storms can create hazardous road conditions. Drivers who fail to adjust their speed and driving behavior for weather conditions may be found negligent if they cause an accident.</p>

          <h2>Types of Car Accident Injuries</h2>

          <p>Car accidents can cause a wide range of injuries, from minor to life-altering. Our Austin car accident lawyers have experience handling cases involving:</p>

          <h3>Whiplash and Soft Tissue Injuries</h3>
          <p>Whiplash is one of the most common car accident injuries, caused by the rapid back-and-forth motion of the neck during a collision. While insurance companies often try to minimize these injuries, whiplash can cause chronic pain and long-term complications that require extensive treatment.</p>

          <h3>Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI)</h3>
          <p>Even a "minor" concussion can have serious long-term effects on cognitive function, memory, and quality of life. More severe traumatic brain injuries can result in permanent disability. If you hit your head or experienced any loss of consciousness, it's crucial to seek immediate medical attention.</p>

          <h3>Spinal Cord Injuries</h3>
          <p>Spinal cord injuries can result in partial or complete paralysis, requiring lifelong medical care and dramatically altering the victim's life. These cases often involve substantial compensation to cover future medical needs, home modifications, and lost earning capacity.</p>

          <h3>Broken Bones and Fractures</h3>
          <p>The force of a car collision can easily break bones, sometimes requiring surgery, hardware implantation, and extensive physical therapy. Some fractures may result in permanent limitations or chronic pain.</p>

          <h3>Internal Injuries</h3>
          <p>Internal bleeding and organ damage may not be immediately apparent after an accident, making prompt medical evaluation essential. These hidden injuries can be life-threatening if not diagnosed and treated quickly.</p>

          <h3>Cuts, Lacerations, and Burns</h3>
          <p>Broken glass, deployed airbags, and post-accident fires can cause serious cuts, lacerations, and burns that may result in permanent scarring and disfigurement.</p>

          <h2>Compensation for Austin Car Accident Victims</h2>

          <p>If you've been injured in a car accident caused by someone else's negligence, Texas law entitles you to seek compensation for your damages. At The Juris Firm, we work diligently to recover every dollar you deserve, including:</p>

          <h3>Medical Expenses</h3>
          <p>This includes all past and future medical care related to your injuries—emergency room visits, hospital stays, surgeries, doctor appointments, physical therapy, prescription medications, medical equipment, and any other necessary treatment.</p>

          <h3>Lost Wages and Earning Capacity</h3>
          <p>If your injuries prevent you from working, you can recover compensation for lost income. If your injuries permanently affect your ability to work or earn at your previous level, you may also be entitled to compensation for reduced earning capacity.</p>

          <h3>Pain and Suffering</h3>
          <p>Texas law recognizes that accident victims deserve compensation for the physical pain and emotional suffering caused by their injuries. This includes compensation for anxiety, depression, loss of enjoyment of life, and the overall impact on your well-being.</p>

          <h3>Property Damage</h3>
          <p>You're entitled to compensation for the repair or replacement of your vehicle and any personal property damaged in the accident.</p>

          <h3>Loss of Consortium</h3>
          <p>In serious injury cases, your spouse may have a separate claim for loss of companionship, affection, and other aspects of your relationship that have been affected by your injuries.</p>

          <h2>Dealing with Insurance Companies</h2>

          <p>After a car accident, you'll likely receive a call from the at-fault driver's insurance company. It's important to understand that insurance adjusters are not on your side—their job is to minimize the company's payout, not to ensure you receive fair compensation.</p>

          <p>Common insurance company tactics include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Requesting recorded statements</strong> that can be used against you</li>
            <li><strong>Offering quick, lowball settlements</strong> before you understand the full extent of your injuries</li>
            <li><strong>Denying or delaying claims</strong> hoping you'll give up or accept less</li>
            <li><strong>Arguing you were partially at fault</strong> to reduce their liability</li>
            <li><strong>Disputing the extent of your injuries</strong> or claiming they're pre-existing</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Having an experienced Austin car accident lawyer on your side levels the playing field. We handle all communications with insurance companies, protect you from their tactics, and fight for the full compensation you deserve.</p>

          <h2>Texas Car Accident Laws You Should Know</h2>

          <h3>Two-Year Statute of Limitations</h3>
          <p>In Texas, you have two years from the date of your car accident to file a lawsuit. While this may seem like plenty of time, evidence can disappear, witnesses' memories fade, and building a strong case takes time. It's important to contact an attorney as soon as possible after your accident.</p>

          <p><a href="/texas-statute-of-limitations/">Learn more about Texas filing deadlines →</a></p>

          <h3>Modified Comparative Fault</h3>
          <p>Texas follows a "modified comparative fault" rule. This means you can still recover compensation even if you were partially at fault for the accident—as long as you were less than 51% responsible. However, your compensation will be reduced by your percentage of fault.</p>

          <h3>Minimum Insurance Requirements</h3>
          <p>Texas requires drivers to carry minimum liability insurance of 30/60/25—$30,000 per person for bodily injury, $60,000 per accident for bodily injury, and $25,000 for property damage. Unfortunately, these minimums often aren't enough to cover serious injuries, which is why we explore all possible sources of recovery for our clients.</p>

          <h2>What to Do After a Car Accident in Austin</h2>

          <p>The steps you take immediately after a car accident can significantly impact your ability to recover compensation:</p>

          <ol class="numbered-list">
            <li><strong>Check for injuries and call 911.</strong> Your health is the top priority. Even if you feel fine, some injuries don't appear immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>Move to safety if possible.</strong> If your vehicle is drivable and it's safe to do so, move out of traffic to prevent additional accidents.</li>
            <li><strong>Document everything.</strong> Take photos of all vehicles involved, the accident scene, road conditions, traffic signals, and any visible injuries.</li>
            <li><strong>Exchange information.</strong> Get the other driver's name, contact information, insurance details, and license plate number.</li>
            <li><strong>Talk to witnesses.</strong> If anyone saw the accident, get their contact information.</li>
            <li><strong>Seek medical attention.</strong> See a doctor as soon as possible, even if you don't think you're seriously injured.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't admit fault.</strong> Be careful what you say at the scene—statements like "I'm sorry" can be used against you.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact a car accident lawyer.</strong> Before speaking with insurance companies, consult with an experienced attorney.</li>
          </ol>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Every case is different, and the value depends on factors including the severity of your injuries, the extent of your medical treatment, the impact on your ability to work, and the clarity of fault.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">How long will my car accident case take?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Most car accident cases settle within 6-12 months, but more complex cases or those that go to trial can take longer. We focus on getting you fair compensation as efficiently as possible while never rushing to accept an inadequate settlement.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">What if the other driver doesn't have insurance?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>If you have uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) coverage on your own policy, you can make a claim through your insurance company. We also investigate whether there are other potentially liable parties or sources of recovery.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">Should I accept the insurance company's first offer?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Almost never. Insurance companies typically make low initial offers hoping you'll accept before you understand the full extent of your injuries and damages. Let us review any offer before you accept—we can usually negotiate a significantly higher settlement.</p>
