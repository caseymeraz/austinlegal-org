                        <h2>Texas Dog Bite Laws</h2>

                        <h3>The "One Bite" Rule</h3>
                        <p>Texas follows a modified "one bite" rule for dog bite liability. This doesn't mean dogs literally get one free bite. Instead, it means owners can be held liable if they knew or should have known their dog had dangerous propensities. Evidence that an owner knew their dog was dangerous includes prior bites or attacks, aggressive behavior toward people or animals, complaints from neighbors, and the dog's history of lunging, growling, or attempting to bite.</p>

                        <h3>Negligence-Based Claims</h3>
                        <p>Even without evidence of prior dangerous behavior, dog owners can be held liable under negligence theory. If an owner failed to exercise reasonable care in controlling their dog, they may be responsible for resulting injuries. Common examples of negligence include violating leash laws by allowing dogs to roam freely, failing to properly secure fencing or gates, allowing known aggressive dogs near visitors, and not warning guests about dogs with unknown temperaments.</p>

                        <h3>Strict Liability Situations</h3>
                        <p>In some cases, strict liability applies regardless of the owner's knowledge. This includes violations of local animal control ordinances, dogs that have been officially designated as "dangerous dogs" under Texas law, and cases involving dogs running at large in violation of containment laws.</p>

                        <h3>Landlord Liability</h3>
                        <p>Landlords may also be held liable for dog bite injuries in certain circumstances. If a landlord knew a tenant's dog was dangerous and failed to require removal, they may share responsibility. This is particularly relevant in apartment complexes and rental properties where landlords have ongoing knowledge of tenant pets.</p>

                        <h2>Common Dog Bite Injuries</h2>

                        <h3>Puncture Wounds and Lacerations</h3>
                        <p>Dogs' teeth can cause deep puncture wounds that trap bacteria beneath the skin, as well as tearing lacerations that cause significant tissue damage. These wounds require immediate medical attention to clean, close, and monitor for infection.</p>

          </figure>

                        <h3>Facial Injuries</h3>
                        <p>Dog attacks to the face are especially devastating, often requiring reconstructive surgery and leaving permanent scars. Facial injuries affect victims both physically and psychologically, impacting their self-esteem and social interactions.</p>

                        <h3>Nerve Damage</h3>
                        <p>Deep bites can damage nerves, causing numbness, tingling, loss of sensation, or impaired function. Hand and arm injuries are particularly prone to nerve damage that affects grip strength and fine motor skills.</p>

                        <h3>Broken Bones</h3>
                        <p>Large, powerful dogs can cause crush injuries and fractures, especially when victims are knocked down. Children and elderly victims are especially susceptible to bone fractures in dog attacks.</p>

                        <h3>Infections</h3>
                        <p>Dog bites carry serious infection risks. Rabies, while rare, is fatal if not treated promptly with post-exposure prophylaxis. Bacterial infections including Pasteurella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus can cause cellulitis, abscesses, and systemic illness. Tetanus is another concern for puncture wounds.</p>

                        <h3>Emotional Trauma</h3>
                        <p>The psychological impact of a dog attack often outlasts physical injuries. Victims, especially children, may develop PTSD, severe anxiety around dogs, nightmares, and fear of going outside. These psychological injuries are compensable in Texas personal injury claims.</p>

                        <h2>Types of Animal Attack Cases</h2>

                        <h3>Dog Bites</h3>
                        <p>Dog bites are the most common animal attack, ranging from minor nips to life-threatening maulings. Any dog breed can bite, though certain breeds may cause more severe injuries due to bite force and tenacity.</p>

                        <h3>Dog Knockdowns</h3>
                        <p>Large dogs can cause serious injuries simply by jumping on victims, even without biting. Elderly victims and children may suffer broken hips, head injuries, and other trauma from being knocked down by dogs.</p>

                        <h3>Other Animal Attacks</h3>
                        <p>While dog bites are most common, we also handle cases involving cat bites (which carry high infection risk), exotic pet injuries, and attacks by other domestic animals.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Compensation for Dog Bite Victims</h2>

                        <h3>Medical Expenses</h3>
                        <p>All medical costs related to your attack, including emergency room visits, wound treatment, rabies prevention shots, surgeries (including plastic surgery for scarring), physical therapy, and future medical care for lasting injuries.</p>

                        <h3>Lost Wages</h3>
                        <p>Income lost during your recovery, as well as reduced earning capacity if your injuries cause permanent impairment affecting your ability to work.</p>

                        <h3>Pain and Suffering</h3>
                        <p>Compensation for physical pain from injuries and treatment, as well as emotional distress including anxiety, depression, and fear.</p>

                        <h3>Scarring and Disfigurement</h3>
                        <p>Permanent scarring, especially on visible areas like the face and hands, warrants additional compensation. This includes both the physical disfigurement and its psychological impact.</p>

                        <h3>PTSD and Psychological Treatment</h3>
                        <p>Costs of therapy and counseling to address trauma, anxiety, and fear resulting from the attack. Long-term mental health impacts are taken seriously in calculating damages.</p>

                        <h2>Dog Bites Involving Children</h2>

                        <h3>Children Are Most Vulnerable</h3>
                        <p>Children account for a disproportionate number of serious dog bite injuries. Their small size puts them at eye level with dogs, making face and neck injuries tragically common. Children may also lack the judgment to recognize warning signs of aggression.</p>

                        <h3>Long-Term Impact</h3>
                        <p>Dog bites to children can have lifelong consequences. Scars sustained during childhood may become more prominent as the child grows. Psychological trauma can create lasting fear of dogs and outdoor activities.</p>

                        <h3>Special Considerations in Child Cases</h3>
                        <p>When children are injured, parents file claims on their behalf. The statute of limitations works differently for minors—the clock typically doesn't start until the child turns 18. Any settlement involving a minor must be approved by the court to ensure it's in the child's best interest.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Proving Your Dog Bite Case</h2>

                        <h3>Documenting the Attack</h3>
                        <p>Strong documentation is essential. Photographs of your injuries immediately after and during healing, witness statements from anyone who saw the attack, and animal control reports all help establish what happened.</p>

                        <h3>Establishing Owner Knowledge</h3>
                        <p>To prove the owner knew their dog was dangerous, we investigate prior incidents involving the dog, complaints to animal control or neighbors, "Beware of Dog" signs (which can actually help prove knowledge), and the dog's behavioral history.</p>

                        <h3>Showing Negligence</h3>
                        <p>If knowledge can't be established, we prove negligence by showing leash law violations, failure to properly secure the property, and the owner's general failure to control their animal.</p>

                        <h3>Medical Documentation</h3>
                        <p>Complete medical records documenting your injuries, treatment, and prognosis are essential. Expert medical opinions on permanent effects such as scarring, nerve damage, and psychological impacts strengthen your claim.</p>

                        <ol class="process-list">
                            <li><strong>Seek medical attention immediately</strong> – Dog bites require professional cleaning and may need stitches, antibiotics, or rabies shots</li>
                            <li><strong>Report the incident</strong> – Contact Austin Animal Services or local animal control to report the attack</li>
                            <li><strong>Identify the dog and owner</strong> – Get the owner's name, address, phone number, and insurance information</li>
                            <li><strong>Document everything</strong> – Take photos of your injuries, the location, and the dog if possible</li>
                            <li><strong>Get witness contact information</strong> – Collect names and numbers of anyone who saw the attack</li>
                            <li><strong>Do not give recorded statements</strong> – Insurance companies may use your words against you</li>
                            <li><strong>Contact a dog bite lawyer</strong> – Before speaking with insurance companies, understand your rights</li>

                            <h3>What if the dog has never bitten anyone before?</h3>
                            <p>Texas follows a "one bite" rule, but this doesn't mean owners get one free bite. If the owner knew or should have known the dog was dangerous through prior aggressive behavior—lunging, growling, snapping—they can still be held liable. Additionally, negligence claims (failure to control the dog, leash law violations) don't require prior bites at all.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3>What if I was on the owner's property when I was bitten?</h3>
                            <p>You may still have a valid claim. If you were a lawful visitor (invitee or licensee) rather than a trespasser, property owners owe you a duty of care. Even trespassers may have claims if the owner knew of the trespass and failed to warn of a known dangerous dog. The specifics matter—consult an attorney to evaluate your situation.</p>

                            <h3>Will the dog be put down?</h3>
                            <p>The decision to euthanize a dog is made by animal control through dangerous dog proceedings—it's separate from your civil claim for compensation. Your lawsuit focuses on recovering damages for your injuries, not on punishing the dog. Animal control makes its own determinations based on public safety.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3>How long do I have to file a dog bite claim in Texas?</h3>
                            <p>The statute of limitations for dog bite claims in Texas is generally 2 years from the date of the attack. However, different rules apply for minors—the clock typically doesn't start until they turn 18. Regardless of these deadlines, it's best to consult an attorney as soon as possible to preserve evidence and protect your rights.</p>
